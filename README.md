# NONAME V1
### we suck ass and this is my biggest project btw

good luck even trying to run this

me from october has included the following...
- horrifyingly bad unreadable code (just dont look at the catalog card)
- unfinished admin panel
- half-baked features
- 3 hours of sleep worth of code
- broken migrations (its easy to restore them but Good Luck Anyway)
- extremely messy routes
- unmodified brent's rccsoap
- unreliable gameservers (as reliable as a 2011 audi a4)
- no accept/decline features (because fuck you, you dont deserve it)
- shitty halloween css which can be just compiled bootstrap
- finobe ass frontend
- all thumbnails included because wtf is a gitignore?
- assets
- insecure asset system (u can download anything lol)

have fun trying to decipher this pile of shit that i made in september 
this sucks, no one should have to write code like this
and me, go learn php and try again next time

shut down 2 times, new source might be released soon as i leaked it for 14 days

chatgpt said there are only 2 good things about clientcontroller.php, and it is just basic file handling
nice

uploadcontroller is messy and broken, good luck doing anything vro
